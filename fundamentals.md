# Focus on the fundamentals


NSS is a vocational program. It's our job to prepare students to enter the "real world" of professional technologists. On the web development side of the organization that means we start with students who know nothing about software development and graduate people who can build full-stack web applications. We do this in six months for the fulltime program and one year for the evening program.

Six months or a year may seem like a long time, but when it comes to learning a skill as technically challenging as software development, it really isn't. As an instruction team one of our biggest responsibilities is to determine what topics should be in the curriculum and how much time we should devote to each topic. We make these difficult decisions with one eye on the students and one eye on the calender, and sometimes we don't get to cover a topic as deeply as we would like to.
